                            - MySQL is an online database used worldwide around the globe. This can be used for simple
                            tasks such as creating a shopping list to managing diffent levels of users depending on
                            query handlers. Having a relational database we are able to create "links" between tables by
                            using primary keys and foriegn keys. These keys are what is used to make the connections
                            possible.
                        </p><br></br>
                        <p>
                            - Having an unsecured database system can create a realm of vulnerabilities in a company’s
                            security measures. With one successful injection, a user can break in and gain access to so
                            much more behind the initial checkpoint especially if there isn't further validation. </p>
                        <br></br>
                        <p>
                            - Remember these types of attacks use SQL statements to gain access, the easiest way to
                            prevent these kinds of attacks are to set up properly sanitized database permissions such as
                            validation and session tokens that expire after a set amount of time.
                        </p><br></br>

            <div class="container">
                <h2 class="subTitle centerIt space2" style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">What are SQL queries:</h2>
                <p> SQL is a standardized language used to maintain and manipulate databases to create a custom query
                    specific to what a user needs. These queries are used to execute commands such as data retrieval,
                    data removal and updating what’s currently in the database. Different SQL elements implement these
                    tasks, such as SELECT, WHERE, RETURN, and MATCHING. We can further filter the data with conditional
                    statements or keywords if the results are to broad. </p>
            </div>

            <br></br>
            <!-- code snippet section -->
            <div class="container text-center">
                <p>This is what a typical query may look like. In this example we get the items <span
                        class="boldly">name</span> and <span class="boldly">description</span> from the <span
                        style="font-style: italic;">table:</span> <span class="boldly">Item</span>. </p><br></br>
                <pre class="line-numbers">
                    <code class="language-sql" >
                        SELECT ItemName, ItemDescription
                        FROM Item
                        WHERE ItemNumber = ItemNumber
                    </code>
                 </pre>
                <br></br>
                <p>Looks promising right? Well from here, the web application builds a string query that is then sent to
                    the database to retrieve your data.</p><br></br>
                <pre class="line-numbers">
                    <code class="language-sql" >
                        //Converted query for SQL to read
                        sql_query= "
                        SELECT ItemName, ItemDescription
                        FROM Item
                        WHERE ItemNumber = " & Request.QueryString("ItemID")
                    </code>
                 </pre><br></br>
                <p>But you ask yourself how do we know which item we are referring to? Well this is where we can ask the
                    user for input or have pre-made guided solutions to this problem as to not have a user return
                    something they shouldn't have access to. We then make sure to match the item number given to the one
                    already in the database.
                    The final step is taking the provided users input such as itemid=999 to generate the final query.
                </p><br></br>
                <pre class="line-numbers">
                    <code class="language-sql" >
                        
                        SELECT ItemName, ItemDescription
                        FROM Item
                        //users input
                        WHERE ItemNumber = 999
                    </code>
                 </pre><br></br>
                <p>As you probably guessed already it will return the data on the specific item only in this example and
                    nothing else. </p><br></br>
                <table class="table table-striped" style="background-color: whitesmoke;">
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th scope="col">Item #</th>
                            <th scope="col">Name</th>
                            <th scope="col">Description</th>

                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <th scope="row">999</th>
                            <td>Tomato Sauce</td>
                            <td>You really need a description on tomato sauce? Really? it's just SAUCE in a CAN.</td>

                        </tr>

                    </tbody>
                </table><br></br>
                <p>One thing to note is that we need to make sure each item in a table has a unique identifier so that
                    we can reference it later. This also should not be editable as changing this identifier can cause
                    issues down the line. Instead if we wanted to update or delete an item we can edit the other
                    contents of a specific item in the table.</p><br></br>

            <!--  <p class="card-body " style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-left:10rem; margin-right: 10rem;">Cross-site scripting
                attacks are a type of injection with malicious scripts placed into trusted sites. For this to occur
                generally, the attacker will send browser side script code to a different end user whch inturn the
                unsuspecting user's browser has no way to know if this is a trusted source or not and executes it
                anyways. With this in mind, there have been enough attacks done to create different categies (although
                not all can be classified since there is always an ongoing effort to combat these attacks and can change
                overtime) these are just a few of the known types:
            </p><br></br>
            <p>XSS attacks can generally be categorized into two categories: reflected and stored</p>

                    </div>
                    <p style="padding-top: 2rem;">Reflected attacks are attacks where injected script is reflected off
                        the web server. These attacks are delivered to a victim through routes such as emails or
                        interaction with another malicious site:</p>

                    </div>
                    <p style="padding-top: 2rem;">Stored attacks are those that have the injected script permanently
                        stored on the targets servers such as in databases, forums, comments, ect.</p>
                    <br></br>

            <p style="padding-top: 3rem;">There is one more lesser known attack, known as DOM-based XSS</p>

                            <p>Document Object Model (DOM) based attacks are those that enables attackers to inject
                                malicious payload into a webpage that inturn maniplates the client sides browser

                                <p style="margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">So what do we mean by this? Well these
                                    attacks can change the HTML source code without the need to communicate with the
                                    server. This type of attack is orchestrated on the client-side after the intial
                                    loading of the page. Since the malicious input is stored within the client's browser
                                    enviroment the attack cannot be detected using traditional methods of analysis. </p>
                                <h5 class="underlined">How can we prevent this type of attack?</h5>
                                <p style="margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Just like the attacks before, the goal
                                    is to get infromation on you. DOM-based vulnerabilities allow adversaries to
                                    steal/modify legitimate users' data such as cookies or session tokens to access your
                                    sensative data.</p>
                                <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">Some ways to help prevent these attacks are as follows:
                                </p>

                                    for developers to take action to try to prevent these attacks as this could be
                                    senstive customer data leaked to the attacker which in turn could make your company

                                        Google's API hardening technique.</p>
                                    <h5 class="underlined">Breif Overview:</h5>
                                    <p style="padding-bottom: 1rem; padding-top: 1rem;">Google is a well known tech
                                        company that is widely known for there vast search engine. There are many other
                                        technologies and tasks that happen every single day in the office and one
                                        problem Google tried to tackle was that of XSS attacks. Knowing that people
                                        around the world rely on their product they had to find a way to harden their
                                        cybersecurity force and came up with the idea of creating what they call, API
                                        Harding. </p>
                                    <h5 class="underlined">Initial Preperation: </h5>
                                    <p style="padding-bottom: 1rem; padding-top: 1rem;">Before pouring tons of money
                                        into the development of this new technique, Google had to take the time to
                                        research past attacks and figure out what made them so vulnerable in the first
                                        place. Over two years of time and research was taken to get enough data on the
                                        topic prior to development.
                                        Google brought to the table in a conference meeting their findings and the new
                                        technique that would be later rolled out to all of their various development
                                        departments.
                                        Starting with <a class="text-primary" title="figureOne-link"
                                            data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#figureOne">Figure 1</a> Google
                                        begain breaking down the need for this new technique and tried to bring awarness
                                        to this ever growing threat.</p>
                                    <h5 class="underlined">The Design:</h5>
                                    <p>With extensive research done on the topic, Google found that many solutions to
                                        the problem were solved at the later phases of the software development life
                                        cycle. The problem with this approach is when an application gets so big its
                                        hard to stay ontop of vulnerabilities as the functionality and complexity grows.
                                        Another key problem these applications face are deadlines on specific aspects of
                                        the developmental cycle. A developer will have to split their time on each part
                                        of the bigger project making it hard for them to spend countless time testing
                                        for bugs or security weakness. Only after an attack has been detected will a
                                        developer have to go back to try to find this crack in the code. In responce to
                                        this trend, Googles new approach confronts weakness at the very beginning stages
                                        of web development starting with the compiler.</p>
                                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">API Harding involves three key points in creating <a
                                            class="text-primary" title="safeAPIs-link" data-bs-toggle="modal"
                                            data-bs-target="#safeApis">Safe APIs</a> to help with mitigating potental
                                        XSS threats: Safe Types, Safe Builders, and Safe Sinks.</p>

                                    <h5 class="underlined" style="margin-top: 1rem;">Wide Adoption:</h5>
                                    <p>The last step in the development phase was to test out the new software detection
                                        on a larger scale. Over two years, Google began rolling out this program to all
                                        departments making sure to exempt legacy violations so that exsisting code could
                                        still compile and run while developers took to this new security enforcment.
                                        They have developed acccompanying measures to help with this midigation to
                                        ensure safe practices and answer any questions they may have. In addition,
                                        Google created a "Bug Hunt" Program that actively takes outside sources to comb
                                        through code to point out any missed security weaknesses to ensure a safer
                                        enviroment. In most cases the compiler captures API hardening violations and
                                        will try to automatically construct a fix and present it to the developer with
                                        the error message. Developer feedback is also just as important to help improve
                                        the user experience with this new policy and allows for them to bring up any
                                        concerns or problems faced when implemented in their projects. </p>

                                    <p>With manditory complile-time checks now in place, Google launched infasturcture
                                        and data pipelines to monitor the company-wide adoption progress and the results
                                        showed significat imporvements in the way developers handled XSS attacks prior

                                        is taking time to manually go through exsisitng code and revise it if a
                                        developer feels as if the APIs are not expressive enough to meet there needs .

                                    <h5 class="underlined">Conclusion: </h5>
                                    <p>With the new technique created and implemented Google has taken a new approach on
                                        mitigating XSS attacks by creating API Hardening. Using this new software,
                                        developers can now have safe alternatives genrated for unsafe sinks. This also
                                        takes the approach of catching vulnerabilities at the early stages of the
                                        development cycle. Google has taken the liberty to make most of this program
                                        open sourced so that others can implement this into their own projects and has
                                        brought extensive research to the public for others to review.</p>

                        <p>The code in figure 1 illustrates a web based search application in concept. This example
                            contains a client-side XSS vunerability at line 9, where Javascript code takes in the
                            untrusted users input and renders it to the DOM as HTML markup. </p>
                        <p>The problem with this approach is that there is no way to know what the user will put in here
                            making it possible for attacks! A malicious site can exploit this vulnerability by posting a
                            URL pointing back to the original site and when the user clicks on it, the URL is injected
                            into the search page. Since in this example there is no sanitation or checks on what the
                            user puts in. Perpetrators can insert any content they choose including JavaScript code that
                            can then be executed inside the context of the site the user is on. When this occurs, the
                            capability of the malicious code is no longer restricted by the original security-policy in
                            place and now the infiltrators have unlimited access to the site. What happens next is
                            completely up to them and what they plan to take from the unsuspecting user.</p>

                        <p>With XSS-prone APIs identified and forbidden in the development cycle, Google needed to come
                            up with a set of "Hardened" APIs not known to be vulnerable. In order for a API to be
                            considered "Safe" it has to have met the three critera first: </p>

                        </h5>
                        <p> There are a total of six safe types to cover a majority of attacks known in JavaScript and
                            DOM manipulation. Each safe type corresponds to a type of sink. Values of safe types are
                            immutable once created and are better known as the wrappers of primative strings. The
                            internals of safe types are hidden from developers and in TypeScript, we mark them as
                            private properties. In Javascript, Google implemented additional compile-time checks to
                            forbid any code from accessing these private properties. These properties also prevent safe
                            types from being confuesed with other user-made types.</p>

                            Builders?</h5>
                        <p style="padding-bottom: 4rem;">Builders of safe values are essentially the core security
                            checkpoint for the API Hardening technique. Generally, safe values are secure from sensative
                            DOM sinks due to the static checks in place and APIs ensure they can only be created in ways
                            known to be secure. There are a total of four ways to constuct safe values:</p>
                        <p style=" padding-bottom: 2rem;"><span style="font-style: italic; ">Build from literal
                                values:</span> These values are hard coded by developers and cannot be manipulated by
                            attackers. These can then be safely converted to safe type. One note to know is that literal
                            values are not inhearently secure, only by making the proper checks and making it secure is
                            it safe.</p>
                        <p style=" padding-bottom: 2rem;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Build by sanitizing:</span>
                            Google created built in sanitizers to automatically fix untrustworthy strings into
                            safe-to-render HTML markup or safe-to-follow URLs, removing the known XSS vunerability.</p>
                        <p style=" padding-bottom: 2rem;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Build from template:</span>
                            Building from a template can be seen as a combination of building from constants and
                            building from sanitizing. The bulk of the template is static while some parts can be
                            configured with run-time values.</p>
                        <p style=" padding-bottom: 2rem;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Build from manually reviewed
                                sources:</span> If all else fails and none of the previous options listed before suit
                            your need a developer can use this last method to case any value as a safe value. This is a
                            backdoor technique in the safe API design, however they enforce review requirements by
                            making the developer classify them as prohibited XSS sinks and add them to the exemption
                            list.</p>

                                    version of an API and the new Hardened version of a Safe sink in TypeScript. In
                                    hindsight, safe sinks are the hardened version of XSS-prone JavaScript and DOM APIs.
                                    Typically, safe sinks are type-safe wrappers of the original APIs. If this sink does
                                    not have a safe-type associated with the values given at the time of execution it
                                    will be void instead and not run. </p>
